本代码主要用于Julyedu(https://www.julyedu.com/ )的教学工作，由Julyedu的老师和同学们共同维护，此代码是在Facebook的Detectron2(https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) 代码框架上修改而成。主要用于目标检测，图像分割等课程的教学工作。

### What's New
* It is powered by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep learning framework.
* Includes more features such as panoptic segmentation, densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, etc.
* Can be used as a library to support [different projects](projects/) on top of it.
  We'll open source more research projects in this way.
* It [trains much faster](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html).

See our [blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/)
to see more demos and learn about detectron2.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Quick Start

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md),
or the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD_-m5).

Learn more at our [documentation](https://detectron2.readthedocs.org).
And see [projects/](projects/) for some projects that are built on top of detectron2.

## Model Zoo and Baselines

We provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Detectron2 Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).
